# NLP & Deep Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **NLP & Deep Learning Journey** repository! This repo is a collection of my notes, projects, and implementations as I explore various concepts and techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository serves as a structured learning path covering key NLP and DL topics. It includes:
- 📖 **Conceptual Notes** - Summaries and explanations of important theories.
- 💻 **Code Implementations** - Hands-on exercises, projects, and experiments.
- 🏗️ **Mini-Projects** - Real-world applications to reinforce learning.
- 🔗 **Resources & References** - Helpful links to papers, books, and tutorials.

## 📚 Topics Covered
The repository is continuously updated as I progress. Below are some of the key topics:

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization, Stopwords, etc.)
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Generation (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers)

### **Deep Learning (DL)**
- Neural Networks Basics
- Backpropagation & Optimization Techniques
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [for NLP tasks like text classification]
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)
- Transformer Architecture & Self-Attention Mechanism
- Fine-tuning Pretrained Models

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- NLTK & spaCy
- Scikit-learn

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen understanding of NLP & DL concepts.
